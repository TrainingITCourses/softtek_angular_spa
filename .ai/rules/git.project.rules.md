# Git Project Rules

- Before generating any code clean the git repository by adding and committing all changes.

## Branching

- Use feature branches for each feature named `<feature-slug>`
- Use `main` as the default branch.
- Use `git flow` for branching.

## Commits

- Use `git commit -m "<commit-message>"` for each task.
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages.
